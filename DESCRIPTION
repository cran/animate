Description: Implements a web-based graphics device for animated visualisations.
  Modelled on the 'base' syntax, it extends the 'base' graphics functions to
  support frame-by-frame animation and keyframes animation.
  The target use cases are real-time animated visualisations, including agent-based
  models, dynamical systems, and animated diagrams.
  The generated visualisations can be deployed as GIF images / MP4 videos, as
  'Shiny' apps (with interactivity) or as HTML documents through embedding into
  R Markdown documents.
